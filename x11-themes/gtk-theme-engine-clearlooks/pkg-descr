The Clearlooks engine was originally written by Richard Stellingwerff and
Daniel Borgmann based on the Bluecurve engine. It became very popular and
was adopted as the default theme in GNOME 2.12.
Since then a lot of people have worked on it, and today it is a modular
engine providing multiple styles such as glossy and gummy.
