To enable acceleration to run gnome-shell for Intel (and probably ATI) cards, the 
user running the shell needs to have read/write permissions on /dev/dri/cardN (usually N=0). 

To have access you may put your user on the wheel group or you may use devfs.rules to
change the mode of the /dev/dri/card0; to allow read/write access to the group your
user belongs to or to grant read/write access to any user, i.e (untested):

	add path 'dri/*' mode 0666 group operator

will do both things; will make /dev/dri/* belong to the operator group and give 
everyone read/write access. Please check:

	 man 5 devfs.rules 

for more info. 

NVIDIA cards seems to be fine by default so no further action seems to be needed.
