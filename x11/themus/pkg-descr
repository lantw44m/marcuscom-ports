What is Themus?
===============

Themus is a collection of theme utilities for GNOME. It currently consists of:

* A themes:/// VFS method. You can go to themes:/// in Nautilus to view your
  themes.

* A thumbnailer. Themes in Nautilus will appear as previews.

* A properties page. The Nautilus properties will have a "Theme" tab containing
  details about the theme selected.

* A nautilus context menu item to apply themes from the themes:/// URI.
