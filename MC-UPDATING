This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

2011MONTHDAY:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtk20, avahi-gtk and GNOME 2
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.0 has been added to the ports tree.  GNOME 3.0 and 2.32 desktop
  components are mutual exclusive. There shouldn't be any issue running gtk2
  applications with GNOME 3 or the other way around. 

  The following instuctions are for people wanting to keep using GNOME 2.32.

  # portmaster -o devel/libgdata06 devel/libgdata
  # portmaster -o graphics/libchamplain08 graphics/libchamplain
  # pkg_delete -f vte-0.\*
  # portmaster x11-toolkits/vte
  # portmaster -a

or

does portupgrade handle the extra avahi-header port in avahi-gtk correctly?

  # portupgrade -o devel/libgdata06 devel/libgdata
  # portupgrade -o graphics/libchamplain08 graphics/libchamplain
  # pkg_delete -f vte-0.\*
  # portinstall x11-toolkits/vte
  # portupgrade -a

  If you want to start using the GNOME 3.0 desktop. and you have currently
  GNOME 2.32 installed please use the instructions below.

  Make a list of your installed ports.

  # pkg_delete -fr gnome-\*
mention gnome-icon-* gnome-theme-*
  # portmaster -a

  Go to x11/gnome3 or x11/gnome3-lite and do make install clean.
  Install any missing applications from the list.
