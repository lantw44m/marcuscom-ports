This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  GNOME 3.0 has been added to the ports tree.  GNOME 3.0 and 2.30 are mutual 
  exclusive.  So either you keep GNOME 2.30 or switch to GNOME 3.0. If you want 
  to keep using GNOME 2.30 please follow the next instructions. 

  Portupgrade users:

        # pkgdb -Ff
        # pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
        # portupgrade -aOW

  Portmaster users:

        # pkg_delete -f gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
        # portmaster -a

  If you want to switch to GNOME 3.0 do the following:

        Make a list of your installed ports.
        pkg_delete -r glib-2.\*
        After go to x11/gnome3 and do make install clean.
        Install applications your missing from the list you made earlier.
