This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of GNOME
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports first
  before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully upgrade
  your GNOME installation.  After successfully upgrade, you have to reinstall
  gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly installed.

  Portupgrade users:
    # pkgdb -Ff
    # pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.12\*
    # portupgrade -aOW
    # portupgrade gnome-session

  Portmaster users:
    # pkg_delete -f gtkmm-2.12\*
    # portmaster -a
    # portmaster gnome-session
