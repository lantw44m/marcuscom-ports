This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  GNOME 3.0 has been added to the ports tree.  GNOME 3.0 and 2.32 are mutual 
  exclusive. If you want to stick around with GNOME 2.32 you will not have to
  do anything. However if you want to switch to GNOME 3.0, you should follow
  the instructions below. GNOME 3.0 is based on GTK 3. We did our best to test
  excisting Gtk 2 based programs, but we couldn't test them all. Please let us
  know at gnome@FreeBSD.org if you experiance problems.

  Switch GNOME 2.32 to GNOME 3.0 instructions:

  Make a list of your installed ports.
  pkg_delete -r glib-2.\*
  After go to x11/gnome3 and do make install clean.
  Install applications your missing from the list you made earlier.
