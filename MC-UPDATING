This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: All GNOME users and ports depend on gnomehier
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.20.1. All ports that depend on gnomehier have
  had their DATADIR moved from share/gnome/ to share/ (e.g.
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/gnome/ to ${LOCALBASE}/share/).
  This puts the FreeBSD GNOME ports more in line with the default
  GNOME installation hierarchy. To find the specific directories that
  have changed, see misc/gnomehier/files/dirlist. To upgrade your
  installed ports, you will need to use either sysutils/portupgrade or
  sysutils/portmaster.

    Portupgrade users:
  	# pkgdb -Ff
  	# portupgrade -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
  	# portupgrade -a

    Portmaster users:
  	# portmaster -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
  	# portmaster -a

  If some of icons, applets, themes or other customized items have
  disappered from your desktop in this upgrade, you will need to
  remove and re-add these items to make them appear again due to the
  DATADIR change.
