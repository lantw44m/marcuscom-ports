This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

2011MONTHDAY:
  AFFECTS: users of GNOME 2 desktop components, avahi, libgdata, libchamplain
           and vte
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Please note that these instructions are based on gnome being installed via
  the x11/gnome2 meta port. So if you only a partial installation then some
  of these steps might not apply to your situation.

  GNOME 3.0 has been added to the ports tree.  GNOME 3.0 and 2.32 desktop
  components are mutual exclusive. There shouldn't be any issue running gtk2
  applications with GNOME 3 or the other way around.

  The following instuctions are for people wanting to keep using GNOME 2.32:

  # portmaster -o devel/libgdata06 devel/libgdata
  # portmaster -o graphics/libchamplain08 graphics/libchamplain
  # pkg_delete -f vte-0.\*
  # portmaster x11-toolkits/vte
  # portmaster -a

or

  # pkgdb -F
  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk-\*
  # portinstall net/avahi-gtk
  # portupgrade -o devel/libgdata06 devel/libgdata
  # portupgrade -o graphics/libchamplain08 graphics/libchamplain
  # pkg_delete -f vte-0.\*
  # portinstall x11-toolkits/vte
  # portupgrade -a

  If you want to start using the GNOME 3.0 desktop. and you have currently
  GNOME 2.32 installed, or parts of it, please use the instructions below.

  Make a list of your installed ports.
