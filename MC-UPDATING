This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  GNOME has been updated to 2.21.x. You have to deinstall gnome-applets and
  totem first before use portupgrade or portmaster to upgrade your installed
  GNOME 2.20.x.

  Portupgrade users:
    # pkg_delete -f gnome-applets\*
    # pkg_delete -f totem\*
    # pkg_delete -f gnome-control-center\*
    # pkgdb -Ff
    # portupgrade -a

  Portmaster users:
    # pkg_delete -f gnome-applets\*
    # pkg_delete -f totem\*
    # pkg_delete -f gnome-control-center\*
    # portmaster -a
