This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtk20, avahi-gtk and GNOME 2
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.0 has been added to the ports tree.  GNOME 3.0 and 2.32 desktop
  components are mutual exclusive. If you want to stick around with GNOME 2.32
  The instructions are very simple.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk-\* gtk-2.\* libchamplain-0.\*
  # portmaster x11-toolkits/gtk20 net/avahi-gtk
  # portmaster -r libproxy
  # portmaster -a

  If you want to start using the GNOME 3.0 desktop. you should follow the
  instructions below. GNOME 3.0 is based on GTK 3, but Gtk 2 applications
  should work without any problems with the GNOME 3 desktop.
  However should you run into a application that won't compile or give any kind
  of trouble let us know at gnome@FreeBSD.org and we will take a look at it.

  Switch GNOME 2.32 to GNOME 3.0 instructions:

  Make a list of your installed ports.

  # pkg_delete -fr gtk-2.\* gnome-\*
  # portmaster -r libproxy
  # portmaster -a

  Go to x11/gnome3 or x11/gnome3-lite and do make install clean.
  Install any missing applications from the list.
