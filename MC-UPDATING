This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: All GNOME users and ports depend on gnomehier
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.20.1. All ports that depend on gnomehier have
  been moved from share/gnome/ to share/. A few of stuff are remind in the
  share/gnome/ that are default from ports' tarballs. To know which
  directories that have or haven't been move can be view in
  misc/gnomehier/files/dirlist. To upgrade your installed ports, you will
  need to use either sysutils/portupgrade or sysutils/portmaster.

    Portupgrade users:
  	# pkgdb -Ff
  	# portupgrade -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
  	# portupgrade -a

    Portmaster users:
  	# portmaster -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
  	# portmaster -a

  If some of icons, applets or else have been disappered from your desktop in
  this upgrade, you will need to remove and re-add these stuff to make them
  appear in your desktop again due to change path.

  If you have some themes that was installed by manual (not done by ports or
  packages), then you will have to move from share/gnome/ to share/ by manual.
