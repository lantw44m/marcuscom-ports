The GNOME On-screen Keyboard (GOK) project aims to enable users to control
their computer without having to rely on a standard keyboard or mouse.  Many
individuals must control the computer using alternative input methods.  Using
innovative dynamic keyboard strategies, and leveraging GNOME2's built-in
accessibility framework, the GOK will make control more efficient and enable
use of the GNOME2 desktop.  With the right hardware support and the GOK
individuals will have full access to applications that support the AT SPI, and
therefore, full access to the functionality these applications provide.
